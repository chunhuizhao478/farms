Test a few cases:
(1) Linear shape function, w/o absorber
(2) Linear shape function, w absorber
(3) Quadratic shape function, w/o absorber
(4) Quadratic shape function, w absorber
(5) Linear shape function, w absorber, don't apply on top and bottom
(6) Quadratic shape function, w absorber, don't apply on top and bottom
(7) Quadratic shape function, w absorber, don't apply on top and bottom, add Rayleigh damping (failed!)
