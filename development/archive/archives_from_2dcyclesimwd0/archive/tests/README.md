Test a few cases:
(1) Linear shape function, w/o absorber
(2) Linear shape function, w absorber
(3) Quadratic shape function, w/o absorber
(4) Quadratic shape function, w absorber
New added cases (Nov 9):
(5) Linear shape function, w absorber, don't apply on top and bottom
(6) Quadratic shape function, w absorber, don't apply on top and bottom
(7) Quadratic shape function, w absorber, don't apply on top and bottom, add high stiff damping
(8) Quadratic shape function, w absorber, don't apply on top and bottom, extend damage-allowable region
(9) Quadratic shape function, w absorber, don't apply on top and bottom, small problem
(10) Quadratic shape function, w absorber, close healing, main fault 6km
(11) Quadratic shape function, w absorber, close healing, main fault 4km
